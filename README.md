# Wobo
Wobo would be a software that would try to manage the impact of a disaster. It would be an automatic service for the disaster management centers and the concerned authorities to localise the impacted areas during a catastrophe. Wobo would be based on computer vision. It would use satellite images and check for regions if there is any major change observed, then it would alert all the concerned authorities like nearest police station and hospital, disaster management centers about the disaster and provide them with all the required informations like present situation(images), location of impact, etc.
For future prospects, we will be monitoring the changes in the environment to give a better feedback.
